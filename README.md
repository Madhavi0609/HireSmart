Smart ML-powered resume classification for efficient job role mapping.

ResumeIQ is a Machine Learning and Deep Learning based resume classification system.
It automatically categorizes resumes into predefined job roles by leveraging NLP techniques and classification models.

This project is useful for HR teams (faster resume screening) and developers/researchers (ML/DL experimentation in recruitment systems).

🌟 Key Features

Automated Classification – Categorizes resumes into job roles.

Skill Extraction – Identifies and maps skills to relevant domains.

Multiple Models – Supports ML (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and DL (LSTM, Transformers).

Deployment Ready – Can be integrated with ATS or deployed via Streamlit/Flask.

⚙️ Workflow

Parse resumes (PDF/DOCX/Text).

NLP pipeline cleans, tokenizes, and vectorizes text.

ML/DL model classifies into job domains.

Output: Sorted profiles for recruiters or research experiments.

🛠️ Tech Stack
